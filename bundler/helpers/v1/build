  # NOTE: For native helper specs, Bundler 2 happily reuses test gems installed
  # by the main spec suite, because Bundler automatically searches for Gemfiles
  # in parent directories, so we don't need any extra install for native helper
  # specs.
  #
  # However, Bundler 1 installs gems to a slightly different folder structure by
  # default, so we need to make sure to explicit install test gems with Bundler
  # 1 so that they can be found by Bundler 1. In addition to that, Bundler 1 is
  # very picky about the `BUNDLED WITH` section in the lockfile, which has been
  # generated with Bundler 2 for the main spec suite. So we also need to delete
  # the previously generated lockfile first, so that it has the format Bundler 1
  # likes.
